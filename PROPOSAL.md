## Final Project Proposal : Sorting Algortihm Visualizer
### Overview:
Create a sorting algorithm visualizer using cinder's UI Library that uses bars to represents a value in a vector that can be sorted by some inherent comparable property which in this case will be represented by the height of each bar. Once sorted the bars should have an acsending order from left to right.
### Background Knowledge:
I learned about and finished a pre-written implementation of sorting algorithms in CS125. When learning about these sorting algortihms in 125, we watched a cool animation to visualize different sorting algortihms. That video inspired me to do this project. I think this project is cool because it will enable us to visualize the sorting algorithm step by step. Visualizations are intuitive and simple, people not majoring in computer science can also look at the visualization and might abstract some information out of it. I think this project provides a high level of complexity to be deemed a final project, because of the implementation of these algortihms and integrating the visualization using the cinder library. This project will help me understand and dive deeper into algorithms which are useful tools in computer science. The project might be more difficult than anticipated so I have spaced out the timeline accordingly.
### Rough Timeline:
1st week: During the first week, I will spend time implementing 2 algortithms: QuickSort and MergeSort, while tweaking and working on how I am going to implement and integrate the UI.

2nd week: I will first implement the UI instead of working on the other 2 sorting algorithms I want to do, because the visualization part using cinder library might be the most difficult part of this project and I want to get a good gauge of the effort I'm going to spend doing this. For example, if I haven't finish this in week 2, I can still squeeze it into week 3

3rd week: Implement the other two sorting algorithms: Bubble sort and insertion sort

### Extra features:
If I have enough time by the end of the project deadline, I want to implement a button so that I can visualize all 4 sorting algorithms in parallel. This is cool because we can see how fast each algorithm sorts a vector of unordered elements.
